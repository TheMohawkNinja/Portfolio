# Portfolio
Below is a listing of languages that I am proficient with, including associated repositories I own demonstrating my skill with each language.

## Bash
[play](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/play)

- A wrapper script for my [winrun](https://github.com/themohawkninja/winrun) project, the purpose of this script is to allow me to both start a video game on my Windows machine in addition to switching my monitor input to said Windows machine via [VCP codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_Control_Command_Set) with a simple and plain-English command (e.g. "play minecraft").

## C++
[rpgsh](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/rpgsh)

- My most recent and largest project by far, rpgsh is a shell environment for playing roleplaying games, including object-oriented data types, tab completion, operator overloading, templates, and various utility programs to assist in gameplay.

[WallFade](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/WallFade)

- Linux utility to to replicate the desktop wallpaper fade transition available in Windows 10.

[winrun](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/winrun) and 
[winrun_svr](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/winrun_svr)

- A client/server pair of multi-threaded programs designed to allow easy execution of commands from a Linux terminal to a Windows machine on the LAN. In essence, it is a multi-threaded rsh.

## Deluge

[Integration of PasswordState API in ServiceDesk Plus](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/SDP_PS_Integration/tree/master)

- In order to have an actively updating record of the rotating local admin passwords in ServiceDesk Plus, I have integrated the PasswordState API into ServiceDesk Plus using Deluge in order to insert permalinks to a PasswordState environment into the respective asset entry in ServiceDesk Plus. This neccessitated a novel approach to circumventing Deluge's limitation of only having access to a `foreach` looping structure.

## LaTeX

If you are reading this due to having read my resume, it was written with LaTeX.

[rpgsh-docs](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/rpgsh-docs)

- User documentation for rpgsh.

## Markdown

This very GitHub page :)

## PowerShell

[New User Creation Script](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/NewUserPSScript)

- In order to (at least partially) automate new user creation in an Active Directory environment, I developed the above PowerShell script. It takes the user's first name, last name, and employeeID, then generates the user in Active Directory with a pseudo-random password generated by an external script and then adds the user as a member to the requisite groups for their employement. Prior to the user being created, the script will check to make sure whether or not the user is a re-hire or if there already exists a different employee with the same name before committing the LDAP query.

## Python

[Kraken API Demonstration](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/kraken_trading_example)

- A (so far failed) attempt at beating the market with high frequency cryptocurrency trading by means of a Python script that interfaces with the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. The working theory is that by analyzying which cryptocurrencies are starting to trend upwards or downwards at any given time, the script can automatically buy or sell the respective cryptocurrency.

## zsh

[.zshrc](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/.zshrc)

- My personal .zshrc. It contains hand-written syntax checking, with a green prompt appearing for a valid command (not including arguments), red for a non-existent command, yellow for when a referenced path doesn't exist, and magenta for when there is ambiguity between the command and a directory due to autocd being configured.
