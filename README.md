# Portfolio
Below is a listing of languages that I am proficient with, including associated repositories I own demonstrating my skill with each language.

## Bash
[play](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/play)

- A wrapper script for my [winrun](https://github.com/themohawkninja/winrun) project, the purpose of this script is to allow me to both start a video game on my Windows machine in addition to switching my monitor input to said Windows machine via [VCP codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_Control_Command_Set) with a simple and plain-English command (e.g. "play minecraft").

## C++
[rpgsh](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/rpgsh)

- My most recent and largest project by far, rpgsh is a shell environment for playing roleplaying games, including object-oriented data types, tab completion, operator overloading, templates, and various utility programs to assist in gameplay.

[WallFade](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/WallFade)

- Linux utility to to replicate the desktop wallpaper fade transition available in Windows 10.

[winrun](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/winrun) and 
[winrun_svr](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/winrun_svr)

- A server/client pair of multi-threaded programs designed to allow easy execution of commands from a Linux terminal to a Windows machine on the LAN. In essence, it is a multi-threaded rsh.

## Deluge

[Integration of PasswordState API in ServiceDesk Plus](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/SDP_PS_Integration/tree/master)

- In order to have an actively updating record of the rotating local admin passwords in ServiceDesk Plus, I have integrated the PasswordState API into ServiceDesk Plus using Deluge in order to insert permalinks to a PasswordState environment into the respective asset entry in ServiceDesk Plus. This neccessitated a novel approach to circumventing Deluge's limitation of only having access to a `foreach` looping structure.

## LaTeX

If you are reading this due to having read my resume, it was written with LaTeX.

[rpgsh-docs](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/rpgsh-docs)

- User documentation for rpgsh.

## Markdown

This very GitHub page :)

## PowerShell

## Python

UNDER CONSTUCTION

## zsh

[.zshrc](https://github.com/TheMohawkNinja/.zshrc)

My personal .zshrc. It contains hand-written syntax checking, with a green prompt appearing for a valid command (not including arguments), red for a non-existent command, yellow for when a referenced path doesn't exist, and magenta for when there is ambiguity between the command and a directory due to autocd being configured.
